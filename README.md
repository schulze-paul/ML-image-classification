# ML-image-classification

attempting to get a high test accuracy on the cifar10 dataset with a convolutional neural network:

- run on gpu
- using random crop transforms
- using random flip transforms
- normalizing the data

## initial network architecture

## training
- lr: 0.05
- using negative log likelyhood loss
- using stochastic gradient descent
- using learning rate scheduler

## improving the network architecture

1. using relu after convolutions
1. using batchnorm after convolution relus
1. using relus also after convolutions
